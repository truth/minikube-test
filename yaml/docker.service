# This file is a systemd drop-in unit that inherits from the base dockerd configuration.
# The base configuration already specifies an 'ExecStart=...' command. The first directive
# here is to clear out that command inherited from the base configuration. Without this,
# the command from the base configuration and the command specified here are treated as
# a sequence of commands, which is not the desired behavior, nor is it valid -- systemd
# will catch this invalid input and refuse to start the service with an error like:
#  Service has more than one ExecStart= setting, which is only allowed for Type=oneshot services.

# NOTE: default-ulimit=nofile is set to an arbitrary number for consistency with other
# container runtimes. If left unlimited, it may result in OOM issues with MySQL.
